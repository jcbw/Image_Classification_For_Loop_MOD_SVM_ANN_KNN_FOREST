# Image Classification: For Loop version with modified SVM, including ANN, KNN and Random Forest

For Loop classification using SVM with modifications. All versions of the notebook are compiled here. Code added in for loop, for neighbour and neural network as well. This continues from books (which may include for loop versions in repo):
